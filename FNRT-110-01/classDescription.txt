Introduction to Music
Professor: David McCarthy
Semester: 2185 (2019 Spring)
Time Slot: Unknown

Professor McCarthy is a very harsh and strict professor. No computers are allowed, and any visual presence of electronics of any kind in his classroom are highly discouraged. He holds the opinion that no good music has been created after the 1960s. If you have any opinion in favor of remotely modern music, this class is not suggested for your continued sanity. If you are not a fan of "classical" music in the layperson's sense, AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS. This class WILL break you.
This course is EXTREMELY notes intensive. You are allowed to bring your notes to the exam, and use them freely, and his questions in the tests are directly from the notes. You do not need to learn anything in terms of the class, at least directly. If you are not good at understanding the difference between classical songs, you will need to learn extremely quickly, as it is a good portion of the exam grades. Furthermore, we would recommend doing the concert reports as soon as possible, and doing the additional concert reports instead of the short term paper, because the concert reports are a lot more reasonable, and more lax.
