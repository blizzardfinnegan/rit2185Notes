Homework #6 Assignment (Due next Monday, 02/25 at the start of class):

CHAPTER 16
Individual: Problem #23 (Voltage and current given in RMS)
Team: Problem #26 (use Multisim - Place a small (milli-Ohm or so) resistor in series with L1 to avoid simulation errors.  
Run the simulation from 1Hz to 10kHz, do not start at 0HZ, use log frequency scaling).

CHAPTER 17
Individual: Problems - 1 , 5 AND 14 (voltage given in RMS for ALL three problems, give your ans in RMS)
Team:  Problems - 2 and 8 (R2=1 kohm) (voltage given in RMS for BOTH three problems, give your ans in RMS), 
AND 17 (current given in RMS, give your ans in RMS)
