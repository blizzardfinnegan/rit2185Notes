Reminders

1) HW#7 - Due now (solutions will post this afternoon)
- Individual folder
- Team folder
NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS ACCEPTED

2) Exam #2 - THIS Friday, 03/08, 50 min

- Primarily m/c
- Some of the problems will come directly from the homework assignments, quizzes and 
text examples
- 10 to 15 questions, 4 to 6 different circuits

Chapters:

15 (Series AC Circuits), 2-4Q
> Total impedance, voltage across any element, current through the circuit, etc

16 (Parallel AC Circuits), 2-4Q
> Total impedance or admittance, current through any element, voltage across the elements, etc

17 (Series-Parallel AC Networks), 2-4Q
> Total impedance or admittance, voltage across or current though any element, component values given reactances, or vice-versa

18 (Sources, Source Conversions, MESH), 3-5Q
> Perform source conversions, keep track of polarities, etc
> Perform MESH analaysis with independent and/or dependent sources present (find current, voltage, power, etc)

* No NODAL analysis on this exam *

* Make sure you understand frequency characteristics of these circuits as well
