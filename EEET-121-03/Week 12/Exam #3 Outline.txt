Friday 04/12, 50 mins in class
10 multiple-choice questions (no p/c)
5-7 work the problem and show your work questions (p/c avail)

* You will be provided scrap paper and the text formula sheet (AC) as well as tables 21.1 and 21.2
(the Series and Parallel Resonance Summary Tables)

** You may bring a 3"x5" index card, front and back (no worked out probs or examples)
